//You develop an application that can track users' movement (think of Google Maps). The application complexity is O(N^3) and it takes 100 msec to run data for 1,000 users (N is the number of users).
//How many days it will take your application to run for 1,000,000 users?

// Answer: T(n) = 100 (msec) * (1,000,000 / 1,000)^3 = 100 * 1,000,000 = 100,000,000 msec
