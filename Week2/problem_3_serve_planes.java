// Given the arrival and departure time of planes reaching a particular airport. You need to find the minimum number of gates required to accommodate the planes at any point in time.

// For example:

// P1 = {1:00, 1:10}

// P2 = {1: 40, 3:00}

// P3 = {1:50, 2:20}

// P4 = {2:00, 2:30}

// P5 = {2:15, 3:15}

// P6 = {4:00, 6:00}

// => number of gates required = 4

// What is the complexity of your algorithm? In this problem, N is the number of planes.

// Note: you can simplify the above problems by assuming that the arrival time and departure time are just numbers.
